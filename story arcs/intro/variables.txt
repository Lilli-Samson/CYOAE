You can set variables using for example [code \{x=42\}.] This expression doesn't produce any visible output, it just sets the variable.{x=42}
You can make multiple assignments using a semicolon: [code \{x = 42; y = 2\}.]{x = 42; y = 2}
To display a variable or any expression use [code My favorite number is \{x + 27\}] which renders as My favorite number is {x + 27}.

You can use variables just about anywhere. For example you might write [code \{cutie = "{cutie}"\}] followed by [code \[img \{url \{cutie\}\} \{alt So pretty!\}\]] or just [code \[img \{cutie\}\]] which renders like this:
[img {cutie}]
