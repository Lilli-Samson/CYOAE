You can set variables using for example [code \{x=42\}.] This expression doesn't produce any visible output, it just sets the variable.{x=42}
To display a variable or any expression use [code My favorite number is \{x + 27\}] which renders as My favorite number is {x + 27}.
You can make multiple assignments using a semicolon: [code \{x = 1; y = 2\}.]{x = 1; y = 2}

{123 + 456}
{x+y}
