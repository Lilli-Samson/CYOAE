You can set variables using for example [code \[exec \{code x=42\}\]] or as a shortcut [code \[exec x=42\]].
To display a variable or any expression use for example [code \{x + 27\}].
You can also use this to change variables like in [code \[exec \{code x=1+100/\{x\}\}\]].

[exec {code x=42}]
[exec {code x=42}]
{x + 27}
[exec {code x=1+100/{x}}]
{x}
