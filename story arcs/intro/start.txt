In interactive stories the choices made should matter. Therefore the text will need to reflect the choices. However, writing a new branch for every combination of choises quickly results in a ridiculous number of pages to write, most of them very similar.
To cut down on the clutter you can read and write variables. Say the character passes by a grave of a fallen hero, adorned by his sword. The character gets the choice to pick up the sword or leave it be. You can express that like this:

[code \[choice \{next:travel\} \{text:Take the sword\} \{onclick:weapon="herosword1"\}\]
\[choice \{next:travel\} \{text:Leave the sword\}\]]

which renders like this:

[choice {next:travel} {text:Leave the sword}]
[choice {next:travel} {text:Take the sword} {onclick:weapon="herosword2"}]

The [code onclick] part gets executed when this option is selected and sets variable [code weapon] to value [code "herosword"]. Note that both links point to the same page, the only difference being if the variable is set. We'll look at how to effectively use that variable on the next page. Now make your choice!
